# Novelty

Experiments show that convolutional long short-term memory network (conv-LSTM) outperforms regular LSTM on capturing spatiotemporal correlations. Previous papers have not used this method while exploring the relationship between the distribution of bicycles and the weather, season and events. 

Another method is station-level bike flow prediction using multi-graph convolutionl network. Novelty is viewing the bike sharing system from the graph perspective.
