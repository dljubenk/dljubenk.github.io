## Using RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) for time series prediction

 Time series in this case are describing frequency of bike sharing rides for each day.
 
 Main dataset used is the BLUEbikes data which includes the period of 2016, 2017 and first 3 months of 2018.
 
 Secondary dataset is weaher data for the same time range.
 
 Methods applie are include:
 
 - TimeSeriesGenerator
 
 - SimpleRNN
