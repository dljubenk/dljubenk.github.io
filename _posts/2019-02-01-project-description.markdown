## Proposal

**Data visualization** methods in the domain of digital cities using:
* Data mining
* Graph processing and information network analysis
* Machine learning

Thesis will be conducted at **Massachusetts Institute of Technology**, SENSEable City Lab.
Director of the Lab is [Carlo Ratti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ratti), and project responsibles are [Fábio Duarte](https://tedxbeaconstreet.com/speakers/fabio-duarte/) and [Paolo Santi](http://webhost.services.iit.cnr.it/staff/paolo.santi/).

## Methods

The code will be provided in the form of a Jupyter notebook. Jupyter is a python module, and is available either preinstalled as an Anaconda module, or can be installed manually with pip. In the case of manual installation, the user will also need to install the modules pandas, numpy, and scipy. The files, having an extension ".ipynb", can be run either directly from Jupyter's GUI, or run from the commandline inside the unzipped folder. Running the second command on a windows machine may require adding the Python scripts directory to the PATH variable, located in the subdirectory "Scripts" under the Python installation directory.
