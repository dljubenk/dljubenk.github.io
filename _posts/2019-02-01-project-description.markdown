## Proposal

**Data visualization** methods in the domain of digital cities using:
* Data mining
* Graph processing and information network analysis
* Machine learning

Thesis will be conducted at ***Massachusetts Institute of Technology***, SENSEable City Lab.
Director of the Lab is [Carlo Ratti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ratti), and project responsibles are [Fábio Duarte](https://tedxbeaconstreet.com/speakers/fabio-duarte/) and [Paolo Santi](http://webhost.services.iit.cnr.it/staff/paolo.santi/).

## Background

This study will apply data science methods in order to improve the quality of life in contemporary cities, by investigating ***Bike Sharing Systems***.

> Bicycle sharing system or bike-share scheme, is a service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. The user borrows and returns the bike by placing it in a "dock". If the service doesn't you dock, then it is referred to as "dockless". [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle-sharing_system "Bicycle-sharing system")

In this study, the focus will be on dock bike sharing systems as datasets from this subcategory of bike sharing systems are easily obtained, and mostly publicly available for research purposes - compared to dockless scheme type.

Datasets taken into consideration were collected from bike sharying systems corresponding to different cities and urban areas in United States of America, Canada, Mexico, Brasil, Spain, and UK. An overview of cities included for each country can be observed below.

**United states**: Atlanta (Georgia), joint area of Boston-Cambridge-Somerville-Brookline (Massachusetts), Chattanooga (Tennessee), Chicago (Illinois), Columbus (Ohio), Los Angeles and San Francisco (California), Minneapolis (Minnesota), New York (New York), Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Washington D.C. 

**Canada**: Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver

**Mexico**: Guadalajara, Mexico City

**Brasil**: Porto Alegre, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Sao Paulo

**Spain**: Madrid

**UK**: London

## Methods

The code will be provided in the form of a Jupyter notebook. Jupyter is a python module, and is available either preinstalled as an Anaconda module, or can be installed manually with pip. In the case of manual installation, the user will also need to install the modules pandas, numpy, and scipy. The files, having an extension ".ipynb", can be run either directly from Jupyter's GUI, or run from the commandline inside the unzipped folder. Running the second command on a windows machine may require adding the Python scripts directory to the PATH variable, located in the subdirectory "Scripts" under the Python installation directory.
