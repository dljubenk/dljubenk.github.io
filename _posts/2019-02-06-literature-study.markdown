## Acronyms

BSS = Bike Sharing Scheme (Service)

## Collection Process

A reference management software used to cataloguise relevant papers is called [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/newsfeed), and it is quite similar to [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).
In total, 142 papers in the domain of smart cities transportation had been collected in categories such as: bike reports (11 papers), bike sharing (77 papers), fostering bicycle usage (4 papers), fractal city (3 papers), gender relevance (5 papers), health, environemnt and risk (14 papers), networks accessibility (7 papers), on-demand ride services (3 papers), sensors (6 papers), urban trajectiry analysis (1 paper), and visualization (5 papers). Of course, neither are all papers going to be relevant, not are all papers provided published yet - so only a smallsubset of this resource will be investigated further in order to construct the appropriate research question and knowledge gap for my thesis.

## Paper 1

### "Docked vs. Dockless Bike-sharing: Contrasting Spatiotemporal Patterns"
#### [Grant McKenzie](https://grantmckenzie.com/)
##### [Department of Geography](https://www.mcgill.ca/geography/people-0/mckenzie), McGill University, Montréal, Canada
###### 2018 - 10th International Conference on Geographic Information Science

Focuses on Washington, D.C.

Paper mentions these companies: [Mobike](https://mobike.com/global/), [Spin](https://www.spin.app/) , [Jump](https://jump.com/), [Lime](https://www.li.me/), and [Capital Bikeshare](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/).

Comparisons were made between Lime (dockless) and Capital Bikeshare (docked).

Lime is a private company and Capital Bikeshare is owned by the municipial government of D.C. (also Virginia and Maryland).

Data analysed included only a month of March in 2018. (238,936 individual trips)

Data Attributes: bike ID, time stamps for the start and end of the trip, start and end station IDs.

Temporal aspects: mean duration, median duration, bike trip start times aggregated to the nearest hour of a week and independently
normalized, pattern subtraction

Spatial aspects: Voronoi tessellation used to partition town map into polygons, subtraction of two voronoi patterns

Suggestion: instead of pure unsupervsed learning, use extended layers of urban systems (e.g. amenities? and weather data)

Suggestion: more holistic approach needed to draw meaningful conclusions (e.g. use other transportation networks or include further cities)

Suggestion:  address time-varying networks of bike stations and communities, where different
motifs (loop, chain, star) and temporal evolution dynamics with extended time windows could potentially provide deeper insights into inherent relationships of spatially heterogeneous nodes (stations) or sub-networks (communities)
