## Optimizing Bike Sharing System Flows Using Graph Mining, Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks

This project was conducted at ***Massachusetts Institute of Technology*** - SENSEable City Laboratory, under the direction of [Carlo Ratti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ratti), and being supervised by [Fábio Duarte](https://tedxbeaconstreet.com/speakers/fabio-duarte/) and [Paolo Santi](http://webhost.services.iit.cnr.it/staff/paolo.santi/).

## Background

This study will apply data science methods in order to improve the quality of life in contemporary cities, by investigating ***Bike Sharing Systems***.

> Bicycle sharing system or bike-share scheme, is a service in which bicycles are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. The user borrows and returns the bike by placing it in a "dock". If the service doesn't use docks, then it is referred to as "dockless". [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle-sharing_system "Bicycle-sharing system")

In this study, the focus will be on dock bike sharing systems as datasets from this subcategory of bike sharing systems are easily obtained, and mostly publicly available for research purposes - compared to dockless scheme type.

Datasets taken into consideration were collected from bike sharing systems corresponding to different cities and urban areas in United States of America, Canada, Mexico, Brasil, Spain, and United Kingdom. An overview of cities included for each country can be observed below.

For example, Boston area datasets provided by [BLUEbikes](https://www.bluebikes.com/) consists of timespan between year 2011 and 2018, and for each date include: duration (in seconds), start date and time, end date and time, start station ID and name, end station ID and name, bike ID, user's member type (customer or casual), zip code of user's whereabouts, user's gender. Of course, data can be missing or incorrect which will have to be dealt with in a data cleaning pipeline segment. Datasets are in .CSV format and a snippet of data is represented in the image below.

Also, just as an illustration, for the Boston dataset there are 140'975 entries for a period between 07/28/2011 and 11/30/ 2011 (4 months span).
